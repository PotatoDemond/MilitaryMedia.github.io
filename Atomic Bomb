      <p>Atomic Bombs are pretty cool. Atomic bombs, a.k.a. "The Fat Man" (named that because of its round shape) can effect people in a 13 mile radius. They were first made in the U.S. was in 1945 and the first time the U.S. dropped a Fat Man was the same year on the Japanese city Hiroshima.</p>
<h3>How it Works</h3><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.goC5f-sGYkkEA18Ju4MITwHaEK?w=313&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=2&pid=1.7">
      <p>The science is very complicated, im not going through that torture of trying to understand it however, I will explain the basic details on how it works. In the Fat Man design, there is some explosives set around a chunk of plutonium. So when detenated, the explosives explode making the plutonium reach its critical mass, and then it explodes.</p>
